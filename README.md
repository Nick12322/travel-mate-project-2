# travel-mate-project

TravelMate is a project made for the coding bootcamp at UCSD. The idea behind it is finding someone to show you around a city or place when traveling who is native to it, as they will know the best local bars, restaurants, and activities to participate in and to see.


Each user creates a profile that is rendered in handlebars, and allows them to connect with others, whether hosts or people looking to travel. 

Try searching for London, England on the search bar at the bottom of the home page to see some dummy data, or create your own profile!
